# livox_relocalization_mhss_fde
This repository extends the official livox_relocalization project by integrating a lightweight Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) module for solid-state LiDAR. The method is based on Multiple Hypothesis Solution Separation (MHSS) and introduces point cloud clustering to reduce computation load while ensuring real-time performance.
